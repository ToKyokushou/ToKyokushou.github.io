I'm a third-year Ph.D. student at the Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (JAIST), working on AI-driven design systems and generative models for architecture and urban planning. My research spans **3D vision**, **generative AI**, **urban simulation**, and **multi-modal learning**.

Currently, I'm developing voxel-based early-stage architectural generation methods from sketch and depth inputs, and enhancing **ControlNet** models to support **multi-prompt** and **multi-condition** fusion in urban layout generation. My recent work introduces **spatial memory modules** to improve large-area patch-based generation consistency.

I am fortunate to be advised by researchers in the field of AI for design and spatial computing. My work aims to bridge human-centered design needs and computational intelligence.

I'm open to research collaborations and actively looking forward to academic exchanges in relevant communities.
