**Abstract:**

Dynamic comics are widely used in video production to summarize sequences efficiently but require manual design processes and specialized skills. In this paper, we propose an interactive tool that allows users to convert input videos into dynamic comics. First, the user specifies the segmentation points on the input video. The system then computes the locations of comic panels using a parametric layout model and composites the set of video segments. A user study evaluates the system's effectiveness and gathers feedback on dynamic comic design tools.
