**Abstract:**

3D modeling based on point clouds is an e cient way to reconstruct and create detailed 3D content. However, the geometric procedure may lose accuracy due to high redundancy and the absence of an explicit structure. In this work, we propose a human-in-the-loop sketch-based point cloud reconstruction framework to leverage users cognitive abilities in geometry extraction. We present an interactive drawing interface for 3D model creation from point cloud data with the help of user sketches. We adopt an optimization method in which the user can continuously edit the contours extracted from the obtained 3D model and retrieve the model iteratively. Finally, we verify the proposed user interface for modeling from sparse point clouds.
